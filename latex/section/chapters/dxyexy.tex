\begin{frame}{$D_{xy}$ over $E_{xy}$ slices}
	\begin{block}{}
		$D_{xy}$ distribution over normalized slices of $E_{xy}$
		
		The second peak became visible after the upgrade on the calculation of $D_{xy}$, likely due to improvement on resolution.
		
		The distributions converge after enough multiples of $E_{xy}$.
		
		To avoid this region we discarded the events with high $E_{xy}$ (the $E_{xy} < \SI{0.005}{\cm}$ cut already shown in the previous section) and we fitted only events with $D_{xy}$ higher than a chosen limit.
		Given the choosen $E_{xy}$ cut, the lowest possible limit is \SI{0.02}{\cm}.
