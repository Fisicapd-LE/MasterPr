		\begin{itemize}
			\item $\Pqb\to\Pgm$, used as signal (black line or white surface in the graphs, called bl in the future)
			\item $\Pqb\to X\to\Pgm$, also part of the signal. Includes components with X=\Pqc, \Paqc, \Pgt, 'onia and other rarer decays (blue in the graphs, called bxl)
			\item $\Pqc\to\Pgm$, part of background (green in the graphs, called cl)
			\item fake muons, part of background (red in the graphs, called fake)
